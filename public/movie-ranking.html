<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourites. I love the way a teacher helped his student to overcome the student's problem.</p>

<h3>Hi papa</h3>
<p>This is a movie about a couple who fell apart for their sick daughter who had a nerve problem and again got together for their same daughter.</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful film about love. This flim shows us that love can happen anywhere anytime.</p>
